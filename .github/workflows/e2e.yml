      # Real E2E needs backend.
      # The user setup includes Docker.
      # Setting up full stack in CI is complex. 
      # Often we use mocks or docker-compose in CI.
      # For this task, I will add a step to start backend if possible, or assume mocks.
      # The provided `tests.yml` used sqlite memory.
      # The E2E tests probably need a running backend.
